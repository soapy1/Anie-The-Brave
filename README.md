#Ideas:
 ## Game based around the parrying mechanic from Dark Souls:
- normal attacks
- main character is an unicorn
- tap to parry (with horn)
- two finger hold to move
- tap two fingers to dash
- three fingers to use abilities(tap only)


 - Abilities 
- riposte(attack after successful parry)
- crouch, only useful for certain enemies
- teleport
                
 ## A game where you play as a slime:
- [the type of slime I am thinking of](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Acidic_Swamp_Ooze)
- side scrolling beat-em-up
- pink female protagonist(ohhh big risk)
- rescue your green boyfriend/king/brother/pet/father/prince! (or not and)
- attacks unlock as game progress
- hold side of screen to travel 
- swipe down and hold then release to jump, adjust angle for different trajectory
- two finger swipe at the enemy to parry (yes. slims can parry too.)
- pick up weapons from the adventurers that you slat!
- no armours though, you are a slime
- walking on sand decrease your health
- Certain abilities use life (you attack with your body)


 * Attacks & abilities:
- swipe down to splat
- swipe left or right to do fling your head at the enemy
- quick swipe to certain corner to grapple to it (slim style)
- "tackle" quick swipe through enemy, deal dmg and end up behind the enemy
- hide in rivers or behind trees to sealth!(although you are pink)
- slime bullets! (cause health)
- split in two!(may not add)
