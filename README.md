This is a game, or at least it will be by the weekend!

##to fix bufferoverflow issue, check all component for architectural consistency:
    jre
    android sdk
    python
    pygame subset
 - All of these must be in either 32 or 64 bit.
 
Hour 5: game idea not set, experiencing error with git and pgs4a

#Ideas:
    - game based around the parrying mechanic from Dark Souls:
        - normal attacks
        - main character is an unicorn
        - tap to parry (with horn)
        - two finger hold to move
        - tap two fingers to dash
        - three fingers to use abilities(tap only)
            - Abilities 
                - riposte(attack after successful parry)
                - crouch, only useful for certain enemies
                - teleport
    - A game where you play as a slime:
        - [the type of slime I am thinking of](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Acidic_Swamp_Ooze)
        - side scrolling beat-em-up
        - attacks unlock as game progress
        - hold side of screen to travel 
        - swipe down and hold then release to jump, adjust angle for different trajectory
        - two finger swipe at the enemy to parry (yes. slims can parry too.)
        - attacks & abilities:
            -swipe down to splat
            -swipe left or right to do fling your head at the enemy
            -quick swipe to certain corner to grapple to it (slim style)
