Anie is a Brave little Pink Blob.  She has to be because her programmers are ruthless, making her colling (or not collide) with all sorts of things (or not things).She is a Blob that has to go save her family from the Slime kingdom.  As a total video game archetype, the people who matter most to her have been taken away.

As anyone can tell, we created all the art for the game Anie a Brace Blob Adventure.  We also made the sick beats.  All the programming was done in python, specifically the android pygame subset.
